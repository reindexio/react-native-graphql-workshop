# React Native GraphQL Workshop

In this workshop we will be building a React Native app that communicates with a GraphQL backend. We will use Github GraphQL API. The app will allow users to see the repositories they've starred, search for new ones and star/unstar them.

Clone this repository and follow instructions in `docs/`. There are branches that correspond to the steps, you can checkout the branch to get a clean version ready for the chapter.
